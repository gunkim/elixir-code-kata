# Supermarket Pricing Kata

This project is based on the Supermarket Pricing kata, focusing on the exploration of pricing strategies in supermarkets. It aims to conceptualize various models for pricing, tackling challenges like discounts, promotions, and variable pricing schemes without delving into actual code. The project encourages critical thinking and creative problem-solving around the complexities of retail pricing.
